## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the calculator and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the logic and operations of the calculator.

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/khushijain21200/calculator-web-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd calculator-web-app
   
3. Open `calculator.html` in your preferred web browser:
   open calculator.html


## Usage

- Click the buttons on the calculator to input numbers and operations.
- Use the `AC` button to clear all inputs and reset the calculator.
- Use the `C` button to clear the last entered character.
- Click `=` to see the result of your calculation.

## How It Works

- **Append Functionality**: The calculator uses a simple `append()` function to add the clicked numbers or operators to the input field.
- **Clear and All Clear**: The `clear1()` and `allclear1()` functions help manage input by removing the last character or resetting the entire input, respectively.
- **Calculation Logic**: The `calculate()` function parses the input, handles basic operations, and displays the result. It also handles edge cases like division by zero.
